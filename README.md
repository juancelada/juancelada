# Juan Cruz Celada

Hello! I'm Juan Cruz Celada, a passionate data scientist and machine learning enthusiast.

## About Me

I am a graduate of Henry in Data Science and currently studying to become a Systems Analyst. I love working with data and developing models to solve real-world problems.

## Highlighted Projects

- **[Road Safety Analysis in Argentina](https://github.com/juancelada/PI_01_da_Juan_Cruz_Celada)**: I conducted a project focused on road safety in Argentina. The process included data collection and preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and the development of predictive models to identify patterns and trends. I used technologies such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI to visualize the results and propose improvements in road safety policies.

- **[MLOps Project on the Steam Gaming Platform](https://github.com/juancelada/Pi_Henry_01_Juan_Cruz_Celada)**: I implemented MLOps techniques to analyze data from the Steam gaming platform. The project consisted of four main phases: data preparation (ETL), API development with FastAPI, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. I used technologies such as Python, Pandas, FastAPI, Render, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, and Surprise.

- **[Yelp and Google Maps Reviews and Recommendations Project](https://github.com/bautiarmanicode/HENRY-PROYECTO-FINAL)**: I conducted a comprehensive analysis of reviews and data from Yelp and Google Maps to provide personalized recommendations and predict business growth. I performed ETL processes, sentiment analysis, growth prediction, and recommendation system development. Technologies used include Python, Pandas, SQL, AWS S3, AWS Lambda, NLTK, TextBlob, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebooks, and Power BI.
